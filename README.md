# Research Focus & Education
I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at ShanghaiTech University under the supervision of Prof. H. Qi, with an expected graduation in June 2026. My research specializes in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) quantitative imaging, including:
- Simultaneous multi-parameter CMR quantification
- High-resolution CMR quantitative imaging
- Clinical translation of quantitative CMR techniques

I obtained my B.Eng. in Computer Science from Northeastern University (China).

# Honors & Achievements
- Gold Merit Award, ISMRM Annual Meeting (2025)
- National Scholarship for Doctoral Candidates (2024)
- First-author publications: 1 full paper in Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (JCMR), 6 ISMRM abstracts (4 Oral, 1 Power Pitch, 1 Digital Poster)
